        longDescription: "With a name like Holy Panda, these switches had to be epic. Made with stems from Halo Clears or Halo Trues, with the housing found on Invyr Panda switches, Holy Panda switches combine the best of two worlds. The result is a snappy, tactile switch that is satisfying to type on. This time around we won't be pre-lubing the switches. As the original tooling is too damaged to make a new run, this batch will be made with updated tooling. It’s also worth noting that due to the opaque housing, they won’t let as much per-switch lighting through as some switches.",

The Pearl White base is made of a new plastic that is softer than regular Nylon with the benefits of Polycarbonate. The top housing is designed to reduce wobble and they feature a universal base designed to work with PCB mounted RGBs and all in switch LEDs. The leaf is designed to increase tactility while reducing ping through the use of new materials. These Switches also come with Korean-made stainless springs designed to have minimal ping, giving you a nearly silent typing experience.",
